\usage{
upload_zenodo_certificate(
  zenodo,
  record,
  certificate,
  upload_source = TRUE,
  additional_files = NULL,
  warn = TRUE
)

set_zenodo_certificate(
  zenodo,

  warn = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{zenodo}{- Object from zen4R to interact with Zenodo}

\item{record}{- either a string/numeric containing the record ID, or a Zenodo
record object. If a record ID is provided, the function will fetch the
record; if a record object is provided, it will be used directly.}

\item{certificate}{name of the PDF certificate file.}

\item{upload_source}{logical; if TRUE (default), also uploads the source file
(.Rmd or .qmd) with the same base name as the certificate. The function
first looks for a .Rmd file, then for a .qmd file if no .Rmd is found.}

\item{additional_files}{character vector of additional file paths to upload
(optional). These files are uploaded after the certificate and source file.}

\item{warn}{logical; if TRUE (default), prompts user before deleting existing
files. If FALSE, automatically deletes existing files without prompting
(useful for non-interactive/automated contexts).}
}
\value{
list with upload results: certificate result, source result (if uploaded),
  and additional_files results
}
\description{
Upload the CODECHECK certificate and optional additional files to Zenodo.
}
\details{
Upload the CODECHECK certificate PDF to Zenodo as a draft, along with the
certificate source file (Rmd or qmd) if found, and any additional files. The
certificate is always uploaded first to ensure it becomes the preview file
for the record. The source file is automatically detected by looking for a
file with the same base name as the certificate but with .Rmd or .qmd extension.
If certificate or source files already exist on the Zenodo record, the user is
prompted whether to delete the existing files and upload the new ones, or abort
the operation. This applies separately to PDF certificates and source files,
allowing fine-grained control over what gets replaced.
