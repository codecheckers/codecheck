\description{
Upload the CODECHECK certificate and optional additional files to Zenodo.
}
\details{
Upload the CODECHECK certificate PDF to Zenodo as a draft, along with any
additional files. The certificate is always uploaded first to ensure it
becomes the preview file for the record. If certificate files already exist
on the Zenodo record, the user is prompted whether to delete the existing
files and upload the new ones, or abort the operation.
