\title{Creates filtered CSV files from a register based on specified filters.}
\usage{
create_filtered_reg_csvs(register_table, filter_by)
}
\arguments{
\item{register_table}{The preprocessed register table with enriched columns.}

\item{filter_by}{List of filters to apply (e.g., "venues", "codecheckers").}
}
\description{
The function processes the preprocessed register table by applying filters specified in `filter_by`.
For "codecheckers", a temporary CSV is loaded and processed as the original register.csv
does not have the codechecker column.
The register is then grouped by the filter column, and for each group, a CSV file is generated.
CSV files include all fields that JSON files have (Repository Link, Title, Paper reference).
