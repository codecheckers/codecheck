\arguments{
\item{manifest_df}{- data frame with manifest file information (from copy_manifest_files)}

\item{json_max_lines}{- Maximum number of lines to display for JSON files (default: 50)}
}
\value{
NULL (outputs directly via cat() for knitr/rmarkdown)

\description{
Render manifest files for certificate output
}
\details{
Renders each file in the manifest appropriately based on its file type.
Supported formats include images (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, PDF, TIF, TIFF, EPS, SVG),
text files (TXT, Rout), tabular data (CSV, TSV) with skimr statistics, Excel files
(XLS, XLSX), JSON files (pretty-printed), and HTML files (converted to PDF via wkhtmltopdf).

For PDF files that contain multiple pages, all pages are included using
\\includepdf[pages=\{-\}]. Page count is determined using the pdftools package.
SVG files are converted to PDF using the rsvg package. TIF/TIFF and GIF files are converted
to PNG using the magick package (must be installed). EPS files are included
directly (LaTeX handles the conversion with epstopdf package). JSON files are
pretty-printed with a configurable line limit.

Error handling: If a file is missing, corrupted, or cannot be processed, an error box
is displayed in the certificate output instead of failing the entire rendering. This
allows codecheckers to identify and fix issues with individual files without blocking
the certificate generation.
