`codecheck` is an assistant for conducting CODECHECKs, written in the R language and distributed as an R package.
The goal of codecheck is to ease the process to create a CODECHECK-ready workspace, and to conduct the actual CODECHECK.
Furthermore, the package contains some helper functions for managing the [CODECHECK register](https://codecheck.org.uk/register/).

**Learn more about CODECHECK on [https://codecheck.org.uk/](https://codecheck.org.uk/).**

## Installation

The package is not on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) yet.
Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/codecheckers/codecheck) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("codecheckers/codecheck")
```

## Usage

See the [main vignette](https://github.com/codecheckers/codecheck/blob/master/vignettes/codecheck_overview.Rmd).

## Development

The package uses [`tinytest`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tinytest) for tests.
Run `test_all("/path/to/package")` to run all tests interactively.
Even better, run the tests in a fresh install and temporary directory using 

```r
# assuming . is the package path
library(tinytest)
build_install_test(".")
```
